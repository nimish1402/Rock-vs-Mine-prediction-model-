# Rock-vs-Mine-prediction-model-
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that accurately classifies underwater objects as either rocks (denoted as 'R') or mines (denoted as 'M') using sonar data. Sonar (Sound Navigation and Ranging) is employed to detect and classify objects underwater by analyzing sound waves' reflections.

# Model Development:

1- Utilization of Logistic Regression for its simplicity and efficiency in binary classification.
2- Training the model on a subset of the dataset (training set) to learn patterns and relationships.

# Evaluation:

1- Assessment of model accuracy using both training and test datasets.
2- Computation of accuracy scores to measure the model's classification performance.

# Prediction
1- Capability to predict object classification (rock or mine) for new data instances.
2- Example prediction made using sample input data, showcasing the model's predictive ability.
